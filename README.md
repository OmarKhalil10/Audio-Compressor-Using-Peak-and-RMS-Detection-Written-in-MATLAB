Audio Compressor using Peak and RMS Detection, written in MATLAB

## Objective
The objective of this research is to develop an audio compressor using peak and RMS detection algorithms, implemented in MATLAB. 

The project aims to investigate the effectiveness of peak and RMS detection in controlling the dynamic range of audio signals, and to compare the results with existing compression techniques. 

The research will involve designing and implementing the compressor algorithm, conducting experiments to evaluate its performance on a variety of audio signals, and analyzing the results to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and practicality of the approach. 

The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of more efficient and effective audio compression techniques, which are critical for a range of applications, including music production, broadcasting, and telecommunications. 

Ultimately, the project aims to provide insights into the practicality and feasibility of using peak and RMS detection techniques for audio compression and help inform the design of future audio processing algorithms.

## Running the Test Program
In order to see the compressor working in a number of different ways, open simpleCompressorTest.m in MATLAB and run this file. To hear the various sounds after compression, uncomment the sound lines in the file by removing the % sign from the beginning of the line.
